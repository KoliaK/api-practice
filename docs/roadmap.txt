============================================================
API FLUENCY ROADMAP
Goal: Muscle memory for Python 'requests' and JSON handling.
============================================================

PHASE 1: THE "HAPPY PATH" (Reading Data)
Focus: GET requests, parsing JSON, lists vs dicts.

[ ] Drill 1.1: The Hello World
    - URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1
    - Task: Fetch the data. Print ONLY the "title" of the todo item.

[ ] Drill 1.2: The List Processor
    - URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
    - Task: Fetch all 200 todos. Loop through them. Count how many are "completed": true. Print the final count.

[ ] Drill 1.3: The Data Miner (Nested JSON)
    - URL: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu
    - Task: This JSON is huge. Find the list of 'abilities'. Print the name of the first ability.
    - Bonus: Print the name of EVERY game version (version_group_details) Pikachu appears in.

[ ] Drill 1.4: Query Parameters
    - URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments
    - Task: Use the 'params' argument to fetch only comments for 'postId=1'.
    - Check: The list should have exactly 5 items.


PHASE 2: THE INTERACTION (Writing Data & Security)
Focus: POST, PUT, Headers, and Environment Variables.

[ ] Drill 2.1: The Creator (POST)
    - URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
    - Task: Create a dictionary with 'title', 'body', and 'userId'. Send it via POST.
    - Check: Print the response status code (should be 201) and the new ID.

[ ] Drill 2.2: The Editor (PUT vs PATCH)
    - URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
    - Task A: Update the title using PATCH (partial update).
    - Task B: Replace the whole object using PUT.
    - Observation: Print the response JSON to see the difference.

[ ] Drill 2.3: The Secure Keeper (Environment Variables)
    - Setup: Create a .env file with FAKE_TOKEN=my_secret_123.
    - Task: Write a script that loads this token using os.getenv() and sends it as a Bearer token in the headers to https://httpbin.org/bearer.
    - Goal: Get a 200 OK without writing the actual token in your Python code.


PHASE 3: THE REAL WORLD (Error Handling & Logic)
Focus: Loops, 404s, Timeouts, and File Saving.

[ ] Drill 3.1: The 404 Handler
    - Task: Request a user ID that doesn't exist (e.g., /users/9999).
    - Goal: Write a try/except block that catches the error and prints "User not found" gracefully.

[ ] Drill 3.2: The Timeout Trap
    - URL: https://httpbin.org/delay/3
    - Task: Specify 'timeout=1'.
    - Goal: Catch the 'Timeout' exception and print a custom error message.

[ ] Drill 3.3: The Pagination Loop (Critical Logic)
    - URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
    - Task: Fetch all 100 posts, but do it in chunks of 20 (simulating pages).
    - Logic: Use a 'while' loop. params={'_page': i, '_limit': 20}.
    - Goal: Break the loop when the response is empty.

[ ] Drill 3.4: The Rate Limit Handler (429)
    - URL: https://httpbin.org/status/429
    - Task: This URL always returns error 429.
    - Goal: Write logic that detects status_code == 429, waits for 2 seconds (time.sleep), and prints "Retrying...".


PHASE 4: MASTERY (Optimization)
[ ] Drill 4.1: The Session Manager
    - Task: Create a requests.Session().
    - Action: Set a global header 'User-Agent': 'MyStudyScript' on the session.
    - Test: Make 3 different GET requests using the session object.
    - Check: Inspect response.request.headers to verify your User-Agent was sent every time.

[ ] Drill 4.2: The Final Boss (User Report)
    1. Fetch a User from JSONPlaceholder.
    2. Fetch their Posts.
    3. Save a summary to a text file.
    4. MUST use: Environment variables (even if fake), a Session, and a try/except block.
