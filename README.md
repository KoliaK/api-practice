# API-PRACTICES

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.10%2B-blue)

I decided to create this repository not only to store my coding-challenge solutions but also to keep track of my progress and practice sessions.

# FILES THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL (/docs)

## 🔗 api_json_http.txt
This is a "cheat sheet" document to help me to remember definitions, common patterns, and HTTP methods. I grab a topic from here and apply it to the prompt in a new conversation with Gemini for a practice session.

## 📅 roadmap.txt
Structured plan of studies including drill suggestions.

## 🤖 tutor_prompt.txt
This prompt turns Gemini into a **Algorithms / Data Structure / Python Tutor**, allowing the user to learn and practice common algorithm patterns that are incredibly helpful to develop problem-solving skills.
*(Note: it works well along with Guided Learning mode.)*

## 🌟 Important Considerations!!!
I avoid asking Gemini to "show me the code" at all costs. The only instance where I allow it to generate code is when I've **already** solved the coding-challenge and I'd like to see a "senior approach" for the same problem.
I stick to my own knowledge to solve the challenges, sometimes googling syntax for specific things without ever looking for pre-written solutions.
